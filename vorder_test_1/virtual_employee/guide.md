# Vorder Virtual Employee

Virtual Ordering Employee (VOE) is a software developed to automate the drive thru ordering process. By creating 'flows' and leveraging AI libraries such as NLP (spaCy).

VOE's posess the abilty to respond to human ordering requests and build orders through 'flows'. Each fast food company will need to provide a thorough menu that details all possible items a customer can order, and their potential customizations. We use this data to correctly build a custom 'flow' for each respective fast food company.

Our software will then take a 'flow' and use it to form proper order conversations.
